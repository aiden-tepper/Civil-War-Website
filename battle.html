								<p>Today marks 23 years since the first major land battle of the War Between the States and the first major win for the Confederate army under the command of General P. G. T. Beauregard: the First Battle of Bull Run. It represents the beginning of a long and bloody conflict between the Union and Confederate states. Following the Southern victory, Lincoln and his allies realized the true strength of the Confederate army and the massive scope of the war to come.</p>
								<p>By July of 1861, two months after the standoff at Fort Sumter, General Irvin McDowell was under public and political pressure to begin offensive operations. He and his large Union army of over 30,000 entered Virginia with the goal of capturing Richmond and hastily crushing the rebellion, thus ending the conflict. McDowell knew that his band of newly inducted recruits were ill prepared to fight off the Confederates, but Lincoln ordered him to advance anyways, reasoning (correctly) that their opponents were no better equipped than they were: “You are green, it is true, but they are green also; you are all green alike.” However, the cautious McDowell’s slow movements and information gathered through Confederate spies allowed Beauregard to call for reinforcements and confront the Northerners with a formidable army. The two sides met at Bull Run Creek on July 21 to fight a chaotic battle.</p>
								<p>Congressmen, reporters, and other civilians travelled 30 miles by carriage from Washington DC to eat picnic lunches and watch this grand spectacle unfold. When the Federals pushed back Southern troops in the first few hours, onlookers prematurely celebrated a Union victory, but reinforcements soon arrived and shifted the battle in favor of Beauregard. Panic swept McDowell’s troops when the Confederates launched a counterattack along the entire line, shouting the terrifying “rebel yell” that would become infamous among Union troops. “The peculiar corkscrew sensation that it sends down your backbone . . . can never be told,” one Union veteran wrote. “You have to feel it.”</p>
								<p>Confederate men shattered the Union line, sending McDowell’s troops retreating chaotically across Bull Run and right into the hundreds of picnickers, forcing them to run back north as well.</p>
								<p>Samuel J. English, a Union Corporal of the Second Rhode Island Volunteers, writes his mother a letter describing his experience:</p>
								<blockquote>As we neared the bridge the rebels opened a very destructive fire upon us, mowing down our men like grass, and caused even greater confusion than before. Our artillery and baggage wagons became fouled with each other, completely blocking the bridge, while the bomb shells bursting on the bridge made it "rather unhealthy" to be around. As I crossed on my hands and knees, Capt. Smith who was crossing by my side at the same time was struck by a round shot at the same time and completely cut in two. After I crossed I started up the hill as fast as my legs could carry and passed through Centreville and continued on to Fairfax where we arrived about 10 o'clock halting about 15 minutes, then kept on to Washington where we arrived about 2 o'clock Monday noon more dead than alive, having been on our feet 36 hours without a mouthful to eat, and traveled a distance of 60 miles without twenty minutes halt.</blockquote><br>
								<p>	Many future Confederate leaders fought at Manassas, most importantly being Thomas J. “Stonewall” Jackson. Leading a Virginia brigade from the Shenandoah Valley into battle at a key moment, he helped the Confederates hold an important high-ground position and shift the battle in their favor. He boosted Southern morale and reignited the vigor they began the day with by standing “like a stone wall” and closing a gap in the line against a determined Union attack. Jackson famously told the soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, “Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when you charge, yell like furies!” He would go on to establish himself as a strong and independent commander through his Shenandoah Valley Campaign later that same year, repeatedly outmaneuvering, confusing, and winning decisive victories against superior and vastly larger Union forces.</p>
								<p>	The humiliating Union defeat at Bull Run cost the North around 3,000 casualties and sent the optimistic northerners—who had expected a quick decisive victory—home in disarray. On the contrary, rejoicing southerners instilled in themselves a sense of strength and superiority, and they were given hope that they themselves could pull off a swift victory. However, neither side was entirely correct, for soon after the First Battle of Bull Run both Union and Confederate states would face the reality of a devastatingly long and taxing war that would take an unprecedented toll on the country as a whole.</p>
