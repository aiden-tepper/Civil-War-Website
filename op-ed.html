								<h2>Women Need a Vote, Not a Veto</h2>
								<span class="byline">Elizabeth Ahlborn<br><i>Op-Ed + Reconstruction Article, Michael BD</i></span>
							</header>
							<div style="text-indent:2.0em; font-size:16px">
								<p>	It has been over 16 years since the <i>seemingly</i> constructive and revolutionary 14th amendment was ratified. It has been over 12 years since the <i>seemingly</i> constructive and revolutionary 15 amendment was ratified. It has been over 30 years, time which holds my entire life as of yet, in which I, a white woman, lacked the common right of suffrage. As an educated woman of Bridgewater College and a zealous member of the Virginia State Woman Suffrage Association alongside Anna Whitehead Bodeker, any reader of this article should expect strong opinions regarding the unfulfilled reconstructionist amendments.</p>
								<p>The reason I emphasize the word "seemingly" is simple: the words of the 14th and 15th amendments had amazing intentions with an unfortunate lack of depth and execution. Read the following words of the first paragraph of the constitution, and please realize the irony of my current situation, in which I, a free white woman, could not go out and participate in choosing representation for myself, my family, nor my community.</p>
								<blockquote>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.</blockquote><br>
								<p>This law was ratified in 1868, and as intuitive, independent women, born in the United States and therefore citizens, we figured that we should enjoy the privilege of standing in line behind our husbands to not only witness them vote, but to vote ourselves. Alas, this was not the case.</p>
								<p>Another law, ratified in 1870, disappointed suffragists even more. The potential of this law was incredible. It could have finally birthed a new era of equality by granting <i>everyone</i> legal voting rights, including white people, black people, male people, and yes, female people. Of course, as we know today, there was a grievous lack of inclusion of women in the 15th amendment. It states that <i>the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.</i> I am not so selfish as to reject the benefits of this amendment for men of color, but I am so selfish as to reject the arguments that placing the word <i>sex</i> among <i>race, color, or previous condition of servitude</i> would bring a ghastly end to the world as we know it. In fact, there is proof of the contrary. As of right now, the territories of Wyoming, Utah, and Washington have granted full voting rights. Did an epic celestial disaster reign havoc on these territories? Did the women of these territories unsex themselves? Were their families in disarray? Absolutely not.</p>
								<p>In November of 1871, Ms. Bodeker tried unsuccessfully to vote in a Virginia municipal election based on the 14th and 15th amendments. She was not the only one. I and many other women attempted, but failed to do so, all because the election judges refused to let us carry out what should be considered our right. But was this injustice simply an oddity among millions of occurrences that actually have exhibited the womanâ€™s right to express her liberties? Clearly not.</p>
								<p>The next major letdown, specifically of the 14th amendment, was its inability to hold up against anti suffrage activists in the <i>Minor v. Happersett</i> Supreme Court ruling of 1875. In 1872, a member of the National Woman Suffrage Association, called by the name of Virginia Minor, attempted to register to vote in St. Louis. However, just as Ms. Bodeker in the year before, she was not able to do so. She was thwarted by a voting registrar, Reese Happersett, based on a Missouri law which restricted the right of voting to men. Ms. Minor and her husband sued Ms. Happersett on the grounds that Ms. Happersett denied the plaintiff her <i>privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.</i> Sounds familiar? Yes, that is a direct quote from the previously read 14th amendment. Was this clear and simple request to vote based on the fact that Ms. Minor truly is a citizen with rightful privileges enough to sway the judges? Apparently not. The Supreme Court decided that the aforementioned privileges and immunities of citizenship are not exactly defined by the 14th amendment; therefore, states deciding that suffrage was an exclusive activity for men only did not infringe upon the constitutional rights of women. This technicality ruined what could have been an amazing societal development.</p>
								<p>I know it may seem as though I am personifying and blaming the laws themselves, but in reality, the failure of course lies among the lawmakers and those who support them. If not for them and their narrow mindedness, the United States could have reaped major benefits for gender equality from the reconstructionist amendments. Now and in the future, these amendments will be looked at as lost hopes for the aspiring woman in modern society.</p>
