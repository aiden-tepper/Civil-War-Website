								<p><i><b>INTERVIEWER: </b>Before the war, where were you living?</i></p>
								<p><b>JOHN BROWN: </b>I was on a tobacco plantation in Virginia.</p>
								<p><i><b>INTERVIEWER: </b>How was life like for you before the war in Virginia?</i></p>
								<p><b>JOHN BROWN: </b>As a slave on the tobacco fields, I worked all the time. It was strenuous work, especially on hot days, but the fear of being whipped kept me motivated to work harder. My wife also worked extremely hard. She tended to my Master’s every need around the house, working all day and sometimes even nights. My two boys were too young to be put to work, they were only 5 years old, so my nice master allowed them to stay in the cabin most of the day, and from time to time, they would help their mother around the master's house, cleaning and cooking. My biggest motivation to finish my work as quickly as I could, was to spend time with my family at the end of each day. I loved to sing songs and play the banjo that my two sons made me, from a hollowed out gourd at the end of each night. I would also often tell stories to my children of my ancestors back in Africa. Along with the stories and music to occupy the time before work, I would plant some vegetables in our little vegetable patch that my master gave our family, and then every night my wife would cut up some vegetables from our little vegetable patch and make soup. We didn't have any money so that's how we were able to stay healthy and work long hours every day, like my master wanted. Food was scarce, but we made our efforts to make sure we had enough to work each day. My families bond was stronger than ever. There wasn't much else except for family on these plantations, or at least on this plantation. There were many families on this plantation because our master thought separating us would make us weaker. Without my family, I don’t know how I would have survived.</p>
								<p><i><b>INTERVIEWER: </b>When the war started, were you compelled to break free and fight for the North, or were you satisfied with your life as is and willing to stay with the South?</i></p>
								<p><b>JOHN BROWN: </b>Truthfully, at that point in my life, I only knew of life as a slave because my father before me was a slave, and his father before him was a slave. I was scared to go free, and risk losing my family during that gruesome war. At that moment I stayed as a slave to protect my family from harm.</p>
								<p><i><b>INTERVIEWER: </b>How do you consider your life to be almost 20 years after the war, now that you are free, making your own living as sharecropper?</i></p>
								<p><b>JOHN BROWN: </b>Life is not a easy as I wanted it to be. Like I said above, I only knew the life of a slave before I was freed, and I didn’t know what to expect of freedom. As soon as my family was unshackled from the ties of slavery, we felt hope that life would be better, but little did we know about the life of a sharecropper. It wasn’t until the ratification of the 14th amendment in 1868 and 15th amendment in 1870 that I became a sharecropper. Before that, I worked on a white landowner’s farm to make a living to support my family. Once the amendments were ratified, sharecropping became the new era of agriculture. I no longer have superiors watching over me, telling me what to do. Sharecropping allows me to work my own rented land, at the cost of a portion of the crops that I grow, to the landowner at the end of each year. While I feel a sense of pride living on land that I work to keep, sharecropping comes with serious disadvantages, like debt. I am in a never-ending pile of debt, caused from all the money I borrowed from my landowner to pay for tools for the crops and clothes for my family. This poverty has driven me to sign an unfair treaty with my landowner that leaves me indebted to him for a long time. My lifestyle is similar to that of a slave now with all of this debt. My sleeping quarters are just a wretched  and food just as scarce because I can’t afford anything better, and just as before, I don't know how I would survive without my family.</p>
								<p><i><b>INTERVIEWER: </b>Would you consider your life to be worse off now, than before the war, when you and your family were slaves?</i></p>
								<p><b>JOHN BROWN: </b>I wouldn’t say its any better.</p>
